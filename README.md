Before you get started, make sure you know how to read the charts below. These chord charts represent the neck of the guitar starting with the low E string (thickest string) on the left. The dots with the numbers tell you what fingers to use and where to place them on the fretboard. Finger #1 is the index, #2 is the middle, #3 is the ring, and #4 is the pinky. The notes for each string (from left to right) are E, A, D, G, B, E.
